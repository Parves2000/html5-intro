                <h3>When is the best time to visit there?</h3>
                <p>📅 October to February (especially December–January) <br>

                    ❄️ Winter months offer the clearest views – cold air = less haze <br>
                    🗻 Mount Fuji is beautifully snow-capped <br>
                    🌅 Best chance for stunning sunrise/sunset shots <br>
                    💡 Tip: Go early in the morning (6–9 AM) — clouds often cover Fuji by midday.
